## Etch-A-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch is a fun project created as a requirement for The Odin Project. The goal is to practice DOM Manipulation using javascript.

Etch-A-Sketch is a project that piques the creativity of its users by granting them the ability to draw almost anything. Just hold your left mouse button over the drawing box and start drawing! The project allows for a multitude of colors, with black as a default, and offers rainbow, grayscale, and a color picker that opens up the options to a lot more! The project also has an eraser function to allow for mistakes, and a clear/create function to reset your drawing box, or adjust the pixels of your drawing box.
